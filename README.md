# Mousecam
A digital camera made out of... an optical mouse?!

This project uses a PAW3526DB-FJY2 optical sensor taken from a Logitech B100 mouse as a teeny tiny camera. In this first iteration, I am attempting to do so using an RP2040 Nano that I have on hand. Other hardware is TBA.

# THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!

This project is being made for Moonshot!
